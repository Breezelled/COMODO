# COMODO
Official Repo for COMODO: Cross-Modal Self-Supervised Distillation for Egocentric Human Activity Recognition

All experimental results and ablation study findings can be found in the /results folder.

The dataset folder contains the train, val, and test splits for each dataset, along with our preprocessing scripts. Specifically, ego4d_subset_ids.txt is a subset of all available IMU-containing IDs, which we obtained by applying the official Ego4D filter from their website. This represents the complete subset of data that we can access.
